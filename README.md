# Wine class prediction using Support Vector Machine - Machine Learnign method.

`Support Vector Machine is used using polynomial kernel or the radial basis function kernel to generate Support Vector Classifier that later will be used to classify the data into classes.`

`The method most of the time relies on how scaled the data in the dataset is (since it's based on gradient descent algorithm), and also its hyperparameter values.`

`This notebook shows how to apply the models using python to predict wine class using given features. The dataset is from the sklearn.datasets library.`
