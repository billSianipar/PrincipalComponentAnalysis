# PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on breast cancer dataset.

`This notebook shows how PCA method can in a way "shrink" the number of column of the dataset. Shrinking in this case doesn't mean that the method eliminates the unnecessary columns, and leave the necessary ones. Rather, it just transforms the dataset to n-dimensional dataset. And the transformed dataset represents the relationship inside the original dataset (e.g. a 30-dimensional dataset) in just n number of columns (e.g. a 2-dimensional dataset).`

`And by doing that, PCA can measure how much each column of the original dataset affect the relationship inside the dataset.`

`This notebook shows how to apply the method on the breast cancer dataset provided by Scikit learn library.`
